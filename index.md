PowerShell & F#
---------------

My [SelectXmlExtensions][] PowerShell module can be installed by runnning `Install-Module SelectXmlExtensions`.

I contribute a little to several projects.
My most active repo is [scripts](https://github.com/brianary/scripts), which is mostly PowerShell, but also some F# and other
(primarily Windows) stuff.

Some Old Windows Projects

- [dbscope](https://github.com/brianary/dbscope), a simple GUI to browse databases.
- [magicnumber-lite](https://github.com/brianary/magicnumber-lite), a sort of simplified Windows port of
  [file(1)](http://linux.die.net/man/1/file), which uses
  [magic numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures) in data to determine the format of the data stream.
  (Zip data starts with "PK". Java class files start with 0xCAFEBABE.)
